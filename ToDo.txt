To Do List for AU and possible improvements
1. Checkout branch sparseAU
2. Convert AU to Sparse
3. Enhance overall Performance of system with AU
3. ToDo: optimize processing the SM.input by eliminating the for loop
3. Update AU patterns in batches
3. Study Temporal Pooler permanence with AU
4. Save Spatial pooler for optimal case
5. run for 1000 times for average and scores



Proposed Ideas
1. Checking Anomalies for five entries at a time
2. Fix permanences of SM
3. Parallel computation of SM and AU
