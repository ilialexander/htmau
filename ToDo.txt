To Do List for AU and possible improvements
1. Checkout branch sparseAU
2. Check both SM and SMAU with 8 GB ram
2. Convert AU to Sparse
3. Discuss with Dr. Sarkar the commenting of [51] preSynapticActiveCells in updateSynapses
3. Enhance overall Performance of system with AU
3. ToDo: optimize processing the SM.input by eliminating the for loop
3. Updated AU patterns in batches
4. Save Spatial pooler for optimal case
5. run for 1000 times for average and scores



Proposed Ideas
1. Checking Anomalies for five entries at a time
2. Fix permanences of SM
3. Parallel computation of SM and AU
