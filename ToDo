collect temporal prediction in rsm
collect search time spent in rsm
search time (history and rm)
write time (history and rm)
read time (history)

To Do List for RM and possible improvements
1. Update RM patterns in batches
2. Study Temporal Pooler permanence with RM
3. Save Spatial pooler for optimal case

Proposed Ideas
1. Checking Anomalies for five entries at a time
2. Fix permanences of SM
3. Parallel computation of SM and RM
